Taught by his mother, Mike Kilmer has been playing piano since age seven in 1976. As a teenager his mentors included Perry Robinson (Dave Brubeck band), Joe Ruddick (Phillip Johnston, Dee-Lite) and he studied Third Stream Music under Ran Blake at New England Conservatory. In 1991 Warner Brothers released a record with his band [Sweet Lizard Illtet](https://www.discogs.com/Sweet-Lizard-Illtet-Sweet-Lizard-Illtet/release/2517199) and he has also–with his partner Rivka as MadhaPPy–released on [Bar/None](http://www.bar-none.com/store/mad-happy-feel-good-music-for-the-broke-middle-class?rq=mad%20happy) records.
