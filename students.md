We work with adults as well as children. Generally with children seven years old is a good age to start keyboard lessons. Prior to that, general musical exploration and play.

Lessons are generally scheduled on a consistent weekly or bi-weekly cycle. Students are expected to arrive on time (or if we come to you, be home) or give at least 24 hours advanced notice to cancel or reschedule.

We suggest that each student dedicate a composition book to tracking assignments, areas of focus and progress.
